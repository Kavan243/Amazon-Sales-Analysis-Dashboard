## Project Title: Amazon Sales Dashboard Development Using Power BI

Project Brief: In this project, I designed and developed a comprehensive sales dashboard for Amazon using Power BI. The dashboard provides a detailed overview of key sales metrics and performance indicators to enable data-driven decision-making. Below is a brief description of the dashboard components:

Total Revenue, Profit, and Units Sold:

Total Revenue: $137.35M
Total Profit: $44.17M
Total Units Sold: 513K
Filters:

The dashboard includes interactive filters for selecting specific Country and Year & Month, allowing users to drill down into the data and view detailed insights for specific regions and time periods.
Total Revenue by Sales Channel:

The revenue is broken down by sales channels, with 42.41% coming from Online sales and 57.59% from Offline sales. A pie chart visualizes the distribution of revenue across these channels.
Total Revenue by Order Priority:

The revenue is also segmented by order priority, including High, Low, Medium, and Critical priorities. The highest revenue ($49M) was generated from high-priority orders.
Units Sold by Item Type:

A horizontal bar chart displays the units sold across various item categories. Cosmetics (84K units) and Clothes (71K units) were the top-selling items, while Meat had the least sales (11K units).
Profit & Revenue by Region:

The dashboard visualizes total profit and revenue across different regions, highlighting that Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe are the top-performing regions in terms of revenue ($40M and $33M, respectively).
Number of Units Sold by Year:

A line chart shows the trend in the number of units sold over the years. The peak year was 2012 with 98K units sold, followed by a decline and stabilization in subsequent years.
Key Skills Demonstrated:

Data Visualization: Expertise in creating visually appealing and informative dashboards using Power BI.
Data Analysis: Ability to analyze and interpret sales data to derive actionable insights.
Business Intelligence: Experience in developing BI solutions that support strategic decision-making.
Interactive Reporting: Proficiency in building interactive reports with filters and drill-down capabilities.
This project showcases my ability to transform raw sales data into meaningful visual insights, helping stakeholders to quickly understand performance metrics and make informed business decisions.
